Dataset Description:

The dataset contains financial and credit information about loan applicants, including attributes like income, interest rate, loan purpose, FICO score, and whether the loan was fully paid.

Data Import and Exploration:

pandas is used to load and inspect the dataset.

seaborn and matplotlib visualize the distribution of loan purposes and loan repayment status.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Checks for null values and handles categorical data using get_dummies to convert text-based features (e.g., purpose) into numeric format.

Feature Selection:

Separates the features (X) from the target variable (y), which is not.fully.paid (0 for fully paid, 1 for not paid).

Train-Test Split:

The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance effectively.

Model Selection â€“ Gaussian Naive Bayes:

Naive Bayes is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency, especially suitable for classification tasks with categorical and numeric data.

Model Training:

The GaussianNB model is trained on the training set.

Prediction and Evaluation:

Model predictions are made on the test set, and metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and a classification report are used for evaluation.

Visualization:

countplot from Seaborn helps understand class imbalance and feature distribution.

(Optional) A confusion matrix can visually show prediction performance.

Insights and Use Case:

Helps in identifying risky loan applicants.

Can be used by banks and financial institutions to automate and improve loan approval processes.
